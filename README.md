# E05b-Physics
"""
This was an interesting exercise because I think this is the first one that really gave me pause at how instrumental the little bits of game design are. Something as overlooked as physics and hit detection are taken for granted, but require just as much work and oversight as all of the artistic aspects of a game. When I started this assignment, I was just altering values according to the instructions and seeing what worked. This was mostly guess and check work to try and get everything to how I saw it as normal. for the most part, it was incredibly simple and really not hard to understand at all, which has become a rarity in the recent assignments.
